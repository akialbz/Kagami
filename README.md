# Kagami Library

The Kagami library is a Python package to **reinvent the wheel** and make **my** life easier. It's not at all designed as user friendly. Think twice before you touch it.

The Kagami library only supports Python 2.7 but will be compatible with Python 3.7 in the near future.

The Kagami library is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0.
